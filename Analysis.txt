# The data set consisted of 1888 total mice:  958 male and 930 female (Fig 1) of various ages and weights. In comparison to other medications, Capomulin and Ramicade had longer trials (Fig 2). This might explain the large differences in the IQR of Capomulin/Ramicade versus the medications with shorter studies (Fig 3), but this is speculative.  Capomulin data with mean = 40.68 and median = 41.56 indicating a virtually normal distribution. Ramicade was similar at mean = 40.22/media = 40.68; both drugs with a normal bell curve distribution. The linear regression in Fig 6 for Average Tumor Volume vs Weight with a high correlation value, r = .95, revealing a very strong relationship between the two variables. 

# In Fig 4, there is a noteworthy positive effect in tumor size over time. After Day 5, however, there was an 8-point reduction in tumor volume over the interval to Day 35; largest drop was between day 25 and 35. At that time, however, the tumor size began to increase by one point over the next 10 days. It is recommended that more analyses be done to sort Capomulin efficacy based upon age, sex, weight, or combinations of these. This might provide information into this effect and provide more accurate outcome projections. It is also suggested that Capomulin is most effective over a 35-day course, at which time tumor size began to increase. Further research might include treatment efficacy with other medications used in a consecutive/combined fashion, with other primary therapies, or with adjunct treatment modalities.

# As seen in Fig 3 representing the Final Tumor Volume, both Capomulin and Ramicade, there was a narrow distribution of data with the Capomulin and Ramicade; IQR’s  1.75 and 1.34, respectively. The IQR’s for all other regimens were significantly higher indicating much larger variability in tumor growth.
